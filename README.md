# CS209 Computer System Design and Application

## Introduction to this repository
The structure of this summary is mainly derived from the course materials and experimental materials of the same-name course in the ***Department of Computer Science and Engineering*** of ***Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTECH)***. At the same time, many search engines, including google, edge, and many websites, such as csdn, StackOverflow, chatgpt also gave me great help. Here I would like to express my gratitude to all the above people, websites, etc. who have helped me.
